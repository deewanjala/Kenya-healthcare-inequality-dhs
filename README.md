Kenya Healthcare Inequality Analysis (DHS Data)

Project Overview

This project analyzes healthcare inequality in Kenya using data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The goal is to examine disparities in healthcare access and utilization across different socioeconomic and demographic groups.

Healthcare inequality remains a significant challenge in Kenya, particularly across wealth levels, education categories, and rural versus urban populations. This analysis explores the extent and patterns of these disparities using nationally representative survey data.

Research Objectives

To examine whether wealth index affects access to healthcare services.

To analyze disparities in maternal healthcare utilization.

To compare healthcare access between rural and urban populations.

To investigate the role of education level in healthcare outcomes.

Source: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program

Population: Women aged 15–49

Geographic coverage: National (Kenya)

Note: The raw DHS dataset is not included in this repository due to size and data usage restrictions.
